                Hello, my name is Cole. I am currently a student at Arizona State University
                studying Robotics Engineering. I also do freelance CAD design and animation. In my
                spare time, I enjoy making things in the workshop and competing in robotics competitions.
                
            </p>
          
            <p>
                I have always enjoyed building things and have loved toys like
                Legos and Knex since I was very young.  However, I feel like I
                really got started making when I got a Lego Mindstorms kit when
                I was about 11.  Soon after I got the kit, I received a book on
                how to build your own custom sensors for the Mindstorms
                controller.  Following through the projects in this book got me
                started in building electronic circuits and in
                reverse-engineering devices.  I later moved on to VEX Robotics
                which gave me the opportunity to design some interesting and
                complex mechanisms and BEST Robotics where I had to manufacture
                robot parts out of common items using a multitude of shop tools.
                These three robotics platforms all contributed to helping me learn
                about mechanics, electronics and fabrication.
          </p>

                I started this site while I was in high school to showcase my competition robots.
                All of the projects here are either my own, or done in conjunction with
                my brother.  Occasionally, other people will contribute as well.
            </p>
