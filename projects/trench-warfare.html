		  This is our finalist entry for the 2013 <a href="http://challenges.robotevents.com/challenge/25/entry/683" target="_blank">VRC Game Design Animation Challenge</a>.
		</p>
		
        <p>
          Trench Warfare is played on a 12' by 12' field covered in foam tiles.  A 3" deep trench
		  separates the field, and supports the three scoring channels.  The scoring object is a
		  3" cube with two open faces.  56 of these cubes are distributed throughout the field.  A
		  cube scored in the trench is worth 1 point, a cube scored in one of the low channels is
		  worth 2 points, and a cube scored in the high channel is worth 3 points.  Two alliances
		  of two robots each start on opposite sides of the field.  Each match consists of a 20 second autonomous period,
		  followed by a 2 minute driver control period.  During the match, alliances attempt to score more points
		  than their opponent.  The alliance who scores the most points during the autonomous
		  period gets a 5 point bonus.  Robots can earn an additional three points by finishing the
		  match on the opponent's side of the trench.
